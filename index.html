          <pre>What is the MERN stack?
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
  1) MongoDB — document database
  2) Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
  3) React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
  4) Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server
  <br />
Web Applications:
  => Frontend (Client)
    => HTML, CSS, JS
      => React (Library)
<br />
  => Backend (Server)
    => Node.js + DB
    => Database:
      => MYSQL (SQL)
      => Mongo (NoSQL)

Web Communications Layer
  => Frontend <==> Backend
    => Communication occured by using API
    => API: Application Programming Interface
    => Types:

    Servers Types:
      => Shared Hosting
      => VPS
      
    Server Components:
      => Domain (URI)
        => Connected to the server using DNS (Domain Name Server)
        => Database

            => Mongo
          => Environment (OS)
      
      MERN:
        => M: Mongo Database
        => E: Express.js Node.js Framework
        => R: React.js Frontend Library
        => N: Node.js runtime js environment

=> Domains Examples
1. Example: https://www.mr-dev.tech/mern
  Domain Content:
  => URI = URL + URN
  => URL = https://www.mr-dev.tech/
  => URN = mern
      
2. Example: training.mr-dev.tech/mern
  => URI: training.mr-dev.tech/mern
  => URL: training.mr-dev.tech/
  => URN: mern
      
API: Application Programming Interface
  API: 
  1) Request 
    1) Protocol: HTTP/HTTPs 
    2) URI
      => URI = Uniform Resource Identifier
      => URI = URL + URN
      => URI = Uniform Resource Locator + Uniform Resouce Name
      Example:
        => https://www.mr-dev.tech/mern
        => URI: https://www.mr-dev.tech/mern
        => URI = URL + URN
          URL = https://www.mr-dev.tech
          URN = mern
        => SERVER IP: 45.87.81.78
        => PING IP: 104.21.6.156 
    3) HTTP Request Method
      => GET: Retrieve Data from data source
      => POST: Save or Process data
      => PUT/PATCH:
        => PUT: Send data for update or create if not existed
        => PATCH: Send data for update and nothing happen if not existed.
      => DELETE: Delete data from datasoure
    4) Request Data:
      => POST,PUT,PATCH
        => Data can be sent to server side using Request BODY
        => Request Body Types:
          => KEY: Value
            => Key always String
            => Value: Can be from any type, converted to string

            => Used to send
              => Text
    5) Headers
      => Consists of Key & Value
      => Keys & Values are string
      => Examples:
        => Content-type: application/json
        => Accept: application/json
        => Authorization: TOKEN
          => Has an expiration date
          => Unique for each user
          => Can't be duplicated
          => has many types (Bearer)
2) Response
=> Body
  => Types
    => JSON
      => Java Script Object Notation
      => Each object Consists of KEY: Value
        => Key is always "String"
        => Must add : Between key and value
        => At the end of each key: value pairs we must add , if there is a new pairs after!
        => Value types:
          => String
          => numeric
          => bool
          => null
          => object
          => array
      => JSON Object {}

            <p>What is an API?</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                Modern APIs adhere to standards (typically HTTP and REST), that
                are developer-friendly, easily accessible and understood broadly
              </li>
              <li>
                They are treated more like products than code. They are designed
                for consumption for specific audiences (e.g., mobile
                developers), they are documented, and they are versioned in a
                way that users can have certain expectations of its maintenance
                and lifecycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because they are much more standardized, they have a much
                stronger discipline for security and governance, as well as
                monitored and managed for performance and scale
              </li>
              <li>
                As any other piece of productized software, the modern API has
                its own software development lifecycle (SDLC) of designing,
                testing, building, managing, and versioning. Also, modern APIs
                are well documented for consumption and versioning.
